Telegram bot that suggests the most common pairings for requested ingredient and therefore builds one's own unique recipe.

Written in Python.

Data is parsed from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com"><i>allrecipes.com</i></a> using <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Requests</a> and <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a>.

DB - <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a><br>
Currently there are <b>11k+</b> ingredient pairings in the DB.

Self-made bot profile picture included :)

### Update: An ingredient network visualisation + a tiny analysis.
